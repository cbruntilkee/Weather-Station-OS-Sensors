/* 
 Manchester Decoding, reading by delay rather than interrupt
 Rob Ward August 2014
 This example code is in the public domain.
 Use at your own risk, I will take no responsibility for any loss whatsoever its deployment.
 Visit https://github.com/robwlakes/ArduinoWeatherOS for the latest version and
 documentation.
 
 This program dumps out binary numbers for any Manchester encoded signal that fits the parameters you have entered
 
 It should handle:
 Checking waveform conforms to Machester encoding 
 Any length header (currently set to 10)
 Find the Synching zero
 Discard the zero (and any other bits) if required (currently included in bytes)
 Any number of bytes (Currently set to 8)
 
 What it does not do:
 Is any error checking of data
 Any processing of data (eg reversal of significance within nibbles)
 Calculations to change the data into human redable form.
 Compose messages to the outside world to summarise incoming data.
 
 Filename: DebugVersion_12_BestRaw, 1stAugust 2014
 
 Most of the parameters can be changed to investigate other Manchester encoded signals.
 Readers/users are invited to use the core decoding part of this code to interface with
 other products that use Manchester encoding, or if necessary invent your own with a
 Manchester encoding transmitter.
