My Own GIT-Hub notes


To push changes up to my site

Use GitG to stage the changes into my on-disk repository.

Open a terminal in the GIT-Hub folder and type

 git push origin master

Then supply my user name and passsword.

Will add a new file to the index to be committed:

  git add <filename.any>

then

  commit

to send the file up to the server. Add in comments to explain the commit
and put alterations into perspective.


Also default editor, username and emails can be set as well

  GIT-Hub$ git config --global user.email rl.ward@bigpond.com 
  GIT-Hub$ git config --global user.name Rob Ward
  GIT-Hub$ git config --global core.editor geany

Also

  git status
  git log
