 Oregon Scientific Weather Station and Manchester Decoding, (reading by delay rather than interrupt)
 Rob Ward 2015
 This example code is in the public domain.
 Use at your own risk, I will take no responsibility for any loss whatsoever for its deployment.
 Visit https://github.com/robwlakes/ArduinoWeatherOS for the latest version and
 documentation. Filename: MainWeather_09.ino

 Main_Weather, 24 Dec 2017  (works with Protocol Version 3.0)

 The aim of this version is use the new Manchester decoding routine and incorporate detection
 of a Oregon compatible sensor built to cover novel environmental sensors.
 For example we could have remote temperature sampling, bat detectors, lightning detectors,
 solar power detectors, and earthquake detectors, all reporting back to the WWW server.
 The advantage is that by using the Oregon Scientific Protocol a person can incorporate
 their excellent weather sensors into the overall design and largely keep the Arduino Rx software
 design relatively simple, ie also use their Manchester implementation for our own sensors.

 It may seem this program is encouraging people to build their own replacements for the
 Oregon Scientific sensors, however it is quite the reverse.  The program is designed
 encourage people to purchase the Oregon gear to get the basic wind, temperature, rain
 and humidity sensors and then extend the range with original designs as suggested above.
 If the Oregon sensors are not used, then it does not make sense to use their protocol,
 and any RF other protocol could be as good, or maybe even better in some circumstances.

 Before I discovered the Oregon products, and designed a receiver for it, I was seriously
 considering building my own basic weather sensors. Now I am glad I did not try as the
 quality and price of the Oregon sensors are a very good economic and reliable alternative.

 Have we made the Oregon base station with the LCD redundant?  Well no, not at all. I have
 it in the kitchen and it used by members of the family from day to day and does not take
 anything extra to have it performing a useful monitoring job as well.  However if you want to
 build a system that uses weather data, and combines that with other sensors, and then performs
 other tasks such as switching pumps, or moving blinds then adding an Arduino based 433MHz Rx
 makes an incredibly versatile platform to work with.

 Have we made the Oregon USB to PC models redundant?  Again no, unless you want to take a long time
 writing your own logging and graphing routines.  This program does not even begin to replace
 that level of functionality.

 Have we made the Anywhere OS Internet connection system redundant? Finally, again no!
 This simple Arduino system does not report live to the internet and it would also take a lot
 of effort to even go close to include the features of the OS internet connection system.

 I would encourage anyone looking for a weather sensor based project to consider the Oregon
 Scientific products as they produce a wide range of economically priced but solidly built
 weather sensors.  The mechanical engineering is very good and hard to replicate by the "Geek
 in the Street".  However the scope to extend the usefulness of this data in our designs, by
 combining it with our own sensors (eg soil moisture, or dew point sensors) is truly amazing.

 Have a look here: http://www.oregonscientificstore.com/

 So get some OS gear, an Arduino and get into it :-)

 NB: This program only works with Protocol 3.0 sensors.

 Most of all thanks to Oregon Scientific, who have produced an affordable, high quality product.
 I can now have my LCD Home Base in the kitchen to enjoy, with the Arduino in the garage also
 capturing data for WWW Weather pages.  Lovely!!!!  http://www.oregonscientific.com
 Very Highly recommended equipment. Rob Ward

 The Oregon Scientific UV Detector UVN-800 has been added into to this code as a sensor.
 It appears to have power problems and does not seem to connect as easy as the other sensors.
 However I was foreced to buy it as I could not find a UV transparent material for a window
 to use a cheaper Adafruit sensor (Analog UV Light Sensor Breakout-GUVA-S12SD).  Otherwise
 I was not able to protect the circuit.
 SI1145 Digital UV Index / IR / Visible Light Sensor could also be useful as it reports SPI 
 and can actually give predicted UV levels by measuring Visible light and IR.

 Special thanks to Darko in Italy who corrected an error when decoding negative temperatures. Grazie ragazzi!!!
 
 The Future:
 The Solar Power sensor (a silicon cell's open voltage under sunlight) has been added
 A lightning strike detector has been added with nos of strikes per 45 seconds

/*The following bit has been identified by Xander Zimmerman as a 'battery low' indicator
  He used a variable voltage power supply to test signals from rainfall, temp/hum and anemometer eg
  - no more messages: < 2.1 V
  - switch to low < 2.6 V
  - only 1 Bit used: Byte 4; Bit 6: high => Bat low (Nyb8, Bit 2)
  This aligns with the nybble I suspected contained the Battery level indicator
  However it does not tally with my experiments.  However I used resistors to lower the voltage to the sensor,
  rather than a precise and steady voltage.  I am inclined to accept Xander's opinion here but reluctant
  to change my present strategy of notification if the sensor is not detected at all for 20 minutes.
  This strategy allows for instant collapse of the sensor whether it be low batteries, or the cold, or phyiscal damage
  or the transmitter suddenly being shielded or a lightning strike or any other quick demise.  The Oregon LCD base console
  does not have icons that signal a low battery, or the absence of a signal.  So if the "low battery" transmissions are
  missed then the sensor can drop out before action is taken.
  In the case of some batteries, I have them go "low" overnight when it has been very cold only to act normal again the next
  day as the air temperature rose.  Some sort of flag system in the server code would need to capture and reain that status.
  However I am sure if you see value in using the "battery low" bit, then it will be easy enough to incorporate.
  Xander is also a fan of http://www.openhab.org/ for organising his home systems and also https://github.com/wfrog/wfrog
  for rendering the Oregon information into graphs etc.

 Three tips caused the following
 1 tip=0.04 inches or 1.1mm (observed off the LCD)
 My experiment
 Personally I don't like this value. I think mult by 25 and divide by 1000 IS closer to return mm directly.
 0.127mm per tip??? It looks close the above. Again can't vouch 100% for this, any rigorous assistance would be appreciated.
 Over the last 6 months this has proved to be Ok
