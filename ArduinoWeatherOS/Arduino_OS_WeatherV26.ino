/*Status:  Yet another Oregon Scientific Weather Station 433Mhz Arduino Signal Intercepter
 *MIT Licence
 *Author: Rob Ward April 2014
 *Program Execution Summary-
 *Finds the header bits and synch's to the waveform's 1->0 going edges, which are '1's
 *Sweet spot for timing in this program is 240uS short pulse, 480uS long pulse, or thereabouts???
 *Soaks up rest of header bits and waits for first 0
 *Accumulates incoming data stream into bytes, arranged from MSB to LSB by rotating a mask in a Left Rotate
 *Checks for Sensor ID's, the ID's used here are relative to the previous way the data is collected, so not the same as other authors
 *Using the rotate bit on the fly the two ID bytes are as follows, this program just uses first byte to ID the sensor
 *        Oregon-THGN800   0xAF  	Outside Temp-Hygro    AF 82 ?? 4 ?? 1 (Sensor nybble 1,2or3)  10byte packet (9bytes used)
 *        Oregon-PCR800    0xA2 	Rain Gauge            A2 91 ?? 4 ?? 0                         11byte packet (11bytes used)
 *        Oregon-WGR800    0xA1 	Anemometer            A1 98 ?? 4 ?? 0                         10byte packet (10bytes used)
 *Rolling code 7bits is present to differentiate between alternative sensors, high bit set to 1 for 64 cycles means sensor is new.
 NB Rolling code ignored to ID the sensor as there are no other Oregon Scientifics around me and this avoids problems on sensor resets
 *Calculate the 8bit check sum of nybbles for the sensor and if data passes the test...continue  (2nybbles)
 *Decode the nybbles (if bites are bytes, nybbles are nybbles :-) and calculate the parameters for each sensor
 *On start up wait for a valid reading from each sensor and dump the calculations to the serial, round off to decimal places, every minute.
 
 Why not use interrrupts and count durations?  Manchester encoding came from the time of slow chips, noisey environments and saggy waveforms.
 The beauty of Manchester encoding is that it can be sampled so the 0V logic transitions are the most important and at least the logic 
 state in the middle of the timing periods is most likely to be valid.  It also self synchronises throughout the packet and 
 automatically detects timeouts.  This is an old, classic Manchester decoding decoding strategy, but quite robust never the less.
 Plus the Uno is only doing this task so no problem with it being in the foreground and chewing up most of the CPU cycles there.
 
 To do:
 *find the battery indicators if they exist. (7) suggests it is (my) upper 4 bits of byte[3].  How to fake old batteries??
 I put a 100ohm resistor across the terminals of the anemometer (in the springs) and chose some ordinary but OK batteries.
 I clipped it up and ran it for about 3 days.  After the first 24hr anemometer started to get get shaky and dropping readings
 However the byte[3]==4 all the time and did not change one bit.  I could not spot what bits if any were changing.
 I did the experiment at my son's house away from my system or it would have corrupted the "official anemometer" readings.
 A volt meter showed the voltage was dropping as expected but no clue discovered....

 Most of all thanks to Oregon Scientific, who have produced an affordable, high quality product.  I can now have my LCD Home Base in the
 kitchen to enjoy, with the Arduino in the garage also capturing data for WWW Weather pages.  Lovely!!!!  http://www.oregonscientific.com
 Very Highly recommended equipment. Rob Ward

 My experiment
 Personally I don't like this value I think mult by 25 (it was 42, then 31) and divide by 1000 should be closer to return mm directly.
 0.127mm per tip??? It looks close the above. Again can't vouch 100% for this, any rigorous assistance would be appreciated.
